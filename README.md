# M214A Final Project
Anthony Wong, Mohammad Alkharafi, Borys Jastrzebski

## Installation
If running locally, you can install the environment using conda:
```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This creates an environment called 'xgb'.
Otherwise, create a python virtual environment and install the packages in the environment.yml file.

## To Run
Simply run the cells in the jupyter notebook sequentially. The utility functions are in the separate train.py and preprocess.py files to improve readability.
